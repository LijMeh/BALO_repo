# BALO_repo

This is a code repository to share functions etc. (hopefully) more easily. When we start doing exploratory analyses on the larger datasets it would be great if we could all do it here so that we can access otherâ€™s code and collaborate on analysis.

ps. Please upload your studies as `.rds` files in `01_Data/02_Processed`
